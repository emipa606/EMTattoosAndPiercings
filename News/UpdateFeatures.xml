    <content>There is now two added traits similar to the Transhumanist and Body Purist traits but instead focused on body-modifications. These act the same way where as a body-mod enthusiast would like to have esthetical body-modifications and the body-mod purist does not.
The traits also works with the tatoos and scarifications from the Scarification-mod. If there are other mods that also adds tatoos/scarifications, please leave a comment on the mod-page and they might be able to add support for as well.
